TW(MR) - Notes
==============

### Vision Statement

Because humankind must eventually reach its potential; and all people should be given the opportunity to participate in the process that defines that journey.


#### Mission Statement

The TW(MR) mission is to champion the sharing of transformative ideas; ideas that activate citizens to mindfully impact their micro and macro communities. 


The framework of the TW(MR) effort has three key components:

1) The spirit is captured by its Guiding Principals;

2) "DNA" (i.e., secondary ideals hovering outside the Guiding Principals)

3) Its physical manifestations are furthered by its _______ Toolkit. 



#### Guiding Principals (In no particular order at the moment.)

- Curiosity (Ask: Why?) <=> Imagination (Ask: Why not?)

- Empathy <=> Agency

- Aspire (Ask: Can you help me?) <=> Inspire (Ask: How can I help?)

- Engage <=> Enable

- Influence <=> Impact

- Communication (Use clarity, brevity and context) <=> Acknowledgement (Listen. Listen carefully)

- Truth <=> Trust
 
-  <=> Community  

- Accessibility <=> Fairness

- Selflessness (TBD) <=> Collaboration (Lead by sharing)
 



#### DNA
